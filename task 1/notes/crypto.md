Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption â€”


Symmetric Encryption


1.Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.

2.Faster and suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.

3.Main drawback: Key must be shared, which can be insecure.

Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish


Asymmetric Encryption


1.Uses two keys: a Public Key (for encryption) and a Private Key (for decryption).

2.More secure for key exchange and authentication.

3.Slower compared to symmetric encryption.


Examples: RSA, ECC, DSA
