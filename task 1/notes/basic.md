1.The CIA Triad: Think of the CIA Triad as the three main things you want to protect when dealing with information.

C for Confidentiality (Secrecy) Goal: Keep secrets secret. Only the right people (authorized users) should be able to see the information. Simple Example: Locking your phone with a passcode or scrambling a message with encryption so only the receiver can read it.

I for Integrity (Trustworthiness) Goal: Make sure the information is correct, complete, and hasn't been changed without permission. Simple Example: Using a digital signature to prove a document is the original, or making sure that when you send $10, it doesn't accidentally or maliciously turn into $100.

A for Availability (Access) Goal: Make sure authorized people can get to the information and systems whenever they need themâ€”no crashes or downtime. Simple Example: Having backup power and spare servers so that a website or service is always running and accessible.


2.Threat Types: The Bad Things That Happen 

Phishing (The Digital Con Artist) : Someone sends you a fake email or text pretending to be a trustworthy company (like your bank or a streaming service) to trick you into giving them your passwords or other sensitive details. 

Malware (Nasty Software) : Malicious software designed to damage your computer, steal your data, or take control of your system. This includes things like viruses, worms, and spyware.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) (Digital Traffic Jam) : Attackers flood a website or online service with so much junk traffic (often from a large number of infected computers) that the system gets overwhelmed and real users can't get through, causing the service to go offline. 

SQL Injection (Database Hacking) : A way for a hacker to sneak special, harmful code into a website's input field (like a login box) to trick the website's database into giving up sensitive information, such as a full list of customers.

Brute Force (Guessing Game) : A hacker uses a fast program to automatically try every possible password or key combination until they successfully guess the right one and break into an account or system.

Ransomware (Digital Hold-Up) : A type of malware that gets on your computer and locks up all your files by encrypting them. The attacker then demands a ransom (money) to send you the key to unlock your files.


3.Attack Vectors: How They Get In 

Social Engineering (Tricking People) : Using psychological manipulation to trick a person into making a security mistake, like revealing a password or clicking a malicious link. Phishing is the most common form of social engineering.

Wireless Attacks (Wi-Fi Exploits) : Attacking a network by exploiting vulnerabilities in its Wi-Fi connection, such as cracking a weak Wi-Fi password, or setting up a fake (rogue) Wi-Fi hotspot to intercept data. 

Insider Threats (The Betrayal) : A security risk that comes from inside the organization. This is often a current or former employee, contractor, or partner who uses their legitimate access to steal data or cause damage, either on purpose or by accident.
